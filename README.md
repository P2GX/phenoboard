GA4GH Phenoboard

Curation of individuals with Human Phenotype Ontology and GA4GH Phenopacket Schema.

Phenopboard is still in early development. It makes heavy use of [ga4ghphenotools](https://github.com/P2GX/ga4ghphetools.git)
and some development is using a locally compiled version of this library. Before official release, we will create Mac, Windows, and linux installers for users.


## Run the GUI application in development mode
```bash 
npm run tauri dev
```
