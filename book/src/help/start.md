## ORCID
Before using Phenoboard for the first time, the user needs to enter an [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) research indentifier. Enter just the number (e.g., enter `0000-0002-0736-9199` and not `https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0736-9199`). Phenoboard stores the ORCID in its settings directory (which is automatically created as a hidden directory in the user's home directory upon the first use of the app). From this point on, the ORCID will be automatically loaded upon program start.

## Load the HPO
Before curation, the user needs to load the ``hp.json`` file. We recommend always using the latest version, which can be found in the [Download](https://hpo.jax.org/data/ontology) section of the HPO website. The path to this file is always stored in the settings directory, and the ontology will be loaded automatically upon program start. Users should check if an update is available and if so, download the new ``hp.json`` file and load it in Phenoboard.

## Create a pheboard cohort file

## Select pheboard cohort file
