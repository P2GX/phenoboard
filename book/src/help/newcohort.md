# New cohort

Phenoboard creates cohort files (JSON files) that represent one or more individuals diagnosed with a disease. There are three support disease categories:

- Mendelian
- Melded phenotypes
- Digenic disease

## Choose cohort type
Once we have created a new cohort, we can curate either a phenopacket (one individual, e.g., from a published case report) or a cohort (group or individuals, e.g., from a published cohort report with a table of clinical findings with one row or column per individual).
