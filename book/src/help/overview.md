# Phenoboard Help

Phenoboard offers several ways of curating clinical data. 

## Workflow
In general, phenoboard supports curation of cohorts (which can consist of one or multiple individuals with a specified disease). Users create a new cohort file or open an existing one. following this, Phenoboard provides tools to support curation of individual cases or or external Excel files that contain information about a cohort. Each step is quality-controlled, and text-mining, autocompletion, and rretrieval of information about variants using VariantValidator is provided. After finishing curation, the user can store or update the cohort file, export a collection og phenopackets representing all of the individuals in the cohort file or export an aggregate tab-separate file representing a summary of phenotypic features of the cohort (HPOA format).
