# Applications

Phenoboard is designed to help rapidly and accurately curate case and cohort reports about Mendelian disease from the medical literature. A growing number of software packages is available for analyzing cohorts of phenopackets, some of which we describe here.


- [Genotype Phenotype Correlation Analysis](gpsea.md)
- [Validation of bioinformatics software](validation.md)
- Clustering. Software is in development to cluster (stratify) cohorts of phenopackets 
- Feature-Feature correlation analysis
- [Oncopacket](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41017641/): Integration of cancer research data using GA4GH phenopackets
- [Phenopacket-tools](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37196000/): Java library and application for building and validating GA4GH phenopackets
- [Converting OMOP CDM to phenopackets](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38777085/): A pipeline to transform data from OMOP to Phenopackets
- [phenopacket2prompt](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41092581/): A Java tool to create LLM prompts from phenopackets (can be used to test performance of LLMs at genomic differential diagnostic support.)
- [RareLink](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40385395/): A scalable REDCap-based framework for rare disease data interoperability (integrates phenopackets, FHIR, and RedCap)
