## GA4GH Phenopackets

The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health ([GA4GH](https://www.ga4gh.org/)) is developing a suite of coordinated standards for genomics for healthcare. The Phenopacket is a GA4GH standard for sharing disease and phenotype information that characterizes an individual person, linking that individual to detailed phenotypic descriptions, genetic information, diagnoses, and treatments.
